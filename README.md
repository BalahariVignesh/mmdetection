# MMDetection with Robustness Benchmarking

## Important Notice! 

This pull request was [merged](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pull/1021)!
Please use the original [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) toolbox for robustness benchmarking!

We will keep this fork for a while but may evantually delete it in the future.

## Introduction 

This repository contains a fork of the [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) 
toolbox with code to test models on coprrupted images. It was created as a part of the 
[Robust Detection Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/bethgelab/robust-detection-benchmark) and has been 
submitted to mmdetection as [pull request](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/pulls).

The benchmarking toolkit is part of the paper [Benchmarking Robustness in Object Detection: Autonomous Driving when Winter is Coming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07484).

For more information how to evaluate models on corrupted images and results for a set of standard
models please refer to [ROBUSTNESS_BENCHMARKING.md](ROBUSTNESS_BENCHMARKING.md).

## Robustness Benchmark

Results for standard models are available in [ROBUSTNESS_BENCHMARKING.md](ROBUSTNESS_BENCHMARKING.md).
For up-to-date results have a look at the 
[official benchmark homepage](https://github.com/bethgelab/robust-detection-benchmark).


## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation and dataset preparation.


## Get Started

Please see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for the basic usage of MMDetection.


## Evaluating Robustness


Plase see [ROBUSTNESS_BENCHMARKING.md](ROBUSTNESS_BENCHMARKING.md) for instructions on robustness benchmarking.
